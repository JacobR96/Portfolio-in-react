# Portfolio-in-react

This is a React portfolio created by Jacob Ross, a Junior Web Developer who has experience in the help desk and military fields. This portfolio showcases his skills, experience, education, and contact information.

The portfolio is composed of multiple components, including a navigation bar, a top section with a title and an image, a profile section with a photo and a description, a skills section that highlights his expertise in Security Plus, AWS Solutions Architect, and programming, an education section with information about his graduation from Learn Academy and the U.S. Army School of Medicine, and a contact me section with a button to send an email.

The portfolio uses six images that are imported into the component. They are cloud.png, cloud-service.png, mountain.png, programming.png, profile.png, and cyber-security.png. All of these images are stored in the src/Photos folder.

To use this React portfolio, you need to install React and its dependencies. You can then copy and paste this code into your text editor, save it as a .js file, and import it into your React project. You can also customize the content, images, and styling to fit your needs.

Feel free to use this React portfolio as a starting point for your own portfolio, and don't forget to give credit to Jacob Ross.
